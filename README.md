# Midterm Project Report (AII 600)

**Due:** Wed Mar 18, 2026 11:59pm  
**Points:** 100 Possible (Ungraded)

## Details

Please submit your report as either a **PDF or Word document**.

Do not submit an ipynb, Rmd, R, or py file with comments. You need to take effort to write a nice looking report that anyone could read. I am restricting the file upload types to enforce this.

Please follow the rubric below. **Do not exceed 3 pages in the report (2 is expected).**

### Required Section Headings

Your report must include the following section headings:

1. Introduction
2. Data Description (or Source of Data)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Analysis and Results
5. Conclusions and Future Work

## Rubric

| Criteria | Full Credit | Partial Credit | No Credit | Points |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Introduction** | A brief introduction is provided that provides sufficient motivation for the experiment and clearly states ONE research question of interest (in words). (2 pts) | An introduction is provided, but it does not give sufficient background or motivation for the data analysis; or, an introduction is provided, but it does not clearly state ONE research question of interest. (1 pts) | No proper introduction is provided at all. (0 pts) | /2 pts |
| **Source of Data** | The dataset is described to the best of your ability. A table is provided that lists all of the relevant features in your dataset that you actually used in the analysis. The dataset is suitable for the type of analysis used later in the report. (2 pts) | The dataset is described, but not in sufficient detail. A researcher would have major questions if they tried to replicate your study. The data might have small drawbacks for the planned type of analysis. (1 pts) | No (or very few) details on the data are provided. A researcher would have no clue how to replicate your study. OR, the data you used is completely inappropriate for this type of analysis. (0 pts) | /2 pts |
| **Exploratory Data Analysis** | Relevant figures and tables are provided that summarize the dataset. Each figure and table is given a caption that makes it easy to see what is shown. The language used to summarize the data is clear, concise, and is useful for the analysis. (2 pts) | Graphs and tables are provided, but they are not necessarily in the best format. Most of the figures and tables are explained, but technical jargon is used that makes it hard for people to fully understand. There are minor mistakes. Some figures are not captioned. (1 pts) | No graphs, tables, or figures of any kind is provided, OR The plots/table provided are not readable or convey no useful information to the reader. Figures are not captioned. (0 pts) | /2 pts |
| **Analysis and Results** | At least one method is used that is similar to what we learned in class (or will eventually cover in class). The method is correctly applied and answers the main research question. (2 pts) | At least one method is used that is similar to what we learned in class (or will eventually cover in class), but it might be a stretch. The method is mostly correctly applied, but there are minor mistakes. Some of the assumptions of the method may not have been checked or even discussed. (1 pts) | The methods used are completely incorrect and are not even remotely close to useful for answering the research question. (0 pts) | /2 pts |
| **Conclusion and Future Work** | The conclusion briefly summarizes the report, reflecting on several strengths and weaknesses of the analysis methods used. Some discussion of future work is given. (2 pts) | A conclusion is provided, but it only summarizes the report and does not talk about any limitations on the analysis. Discussion on future work is limited, if present at all. (1 pts) | No conclusion is provided; OR The conclusion makes claims that are not supported by the information in the report. No mention is made of possible limitations or future work. (0 pts) | /2 pts |
